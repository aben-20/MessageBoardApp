Activating models
    Whenever we create or modify an existing model we need to update Django in a
    two-step process:
        1. First, create a migrations file with "makemigrations" command. It creates a
           reference of any changes to the database models
        2. Second, build the actual database with the "migrate" command which executes the instructions
           in our migrations file.

URL Pattern
    The app URL pattern has three parts:
        1. a python regular expression.
        2. a reference to the view.
        3. optional named URL pattern.
